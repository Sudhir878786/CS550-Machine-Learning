The task here is to generate new examples after looking at a sample dataset. We have a choice of 2 datasets here. You can either use VAE or GANs to complete your task.

Dataset Doodles: https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-datasetLinks to an external site.

This is a collection of 50 million drawings across 345 categories Links to an external site., contributed by players of the game Quick, Draw! Links to an external site.. 

Follow the GitHub repo for understanding their formats, how to pre-process and load the data. For the purposes of this assignment, we will just focus on 5 categories: car, bicycle, aircraft, bus, truck

[50 marks ] Task 1: Learn to generate a doodle given an input vector (encoding) of 5 dimensions. Are 5 dimensions enough to produce good-quality doodles? If not, increase the dimensionality till you get good re-constructions.

Using TSNE, visualize your dataset and explain the clusters produced.

[50 marks] Task 2: Generate a doodle that is a mixture of categories using interpolation. Generate multiple images of various combinations (at least 5) such as 

a. Various combinations of bus and truck

b. Various combinations of bus and aircraft (Imagine how this may look)

c. Various combinations of bus and Bicycle (Imagine how this may look)

[50 marks] Task 3: Build an interactive feature where the user can instruct/input what type of doodle he wants to design using these categories.  

 

Alternate dataset with similar corresponding tasks. Pick an instrument family and perform these tasks on the data from the family. For example, you can pick Keyboard or Guitar.
